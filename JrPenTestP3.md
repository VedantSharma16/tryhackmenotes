##### **3.1 Walking an Application**
It means browsing a website to understand how it works, page by page, looking for anything weird or vulnerable. We do this to:
- See how it handles users, forms & requests.
- Understand structure, inputs and functionality
- Look for entry points like login forms, upload boxes etc.

We only use our browser and it's inbuilt tools to perform application walking:
- Developer Tools
- Network Tab (for credentials)
- Application Tab (for cookies)
- URL bar (try adding /admin to end of URL)

###### **Step-by-step execution**
1. URLs & Parameters:
	- Visit different pages
	- Check changes in URL (like changes in product id)
	- Try modifying parameters (`id=999` or `id = abc`)
2. Forms & Inputs:
	- Login forms, search boxes or contact forms
	- Look for the behaviour of site when we input data, good or bad (SQL injections)
3. Cookies & Storage:
	- Go to `inspect` > Application Tab
	- Look at cookies, for any weird tokens (to impersonate) or base64 values(to decrypt into credentials)
4. Network Requests:
	- On the network tab, check for requests, headers and responses
	- Look for API calls or background data fetching
	- Vulnerable sites may hold credentials in plain text here
5. Response Behaviour:
	- Site response to wrong input, empty fields or unauthorized access.

##### **3.2 Content Discovery**
It is the process to find out hidden or unlinked pages, files or directories on a website which are not visible through normal navigation. It is important to perform content discovery as we may find:
- Backup files with passwords and database dumps
- Old admin login pages
- Debug or test pages left by devs
- Hidden APIs or endpoints

###### **Performing Content Discovery**
There are 2 ways to do it:
1. Manual Guessing: We type common folder names in the browser url like: /admin, /backup, /test, /old, /config.php, /robots.txt
2. Automated tools: We use specialised tools to automatically try thousands of possible URLs. Some tools are
	- Gobuster
	- Dirbuster
	- FFUF

*We check the type of content, whether its backup file with passwords, admin login page, configuration file, API endpoint etc, which can give us further clues to exploit the system.* 

##### **3.3 Sub-Domain Enumeration**
It is a process of finding hidden or lesser-known subdomains within a domain. e.g. api.example.com , admin.example.com etc. We find subdomains as it expands the attack surface.  Hidden subdomains often
- Run outdated services
- Don't enforce HTTPS
- Are used by devs and then forgotten
- Aren't protected with login
- Leak data
*All of these are great entry point for attackers*

There are various ways to do subdomain enumeration:
1. Manual guessing: try basic guesses like admin.target.com or test.target.com. 
2. Check certificate transparency logs from sites like `https://crt.sh` or `https://transparencyreport.google.com` as subdomains are mentioned in the certificates. 
3. Use online tools: like `securitytrails.com` , `dnsdumpster.com`, `subdomainfinder.c99.nl` 
4. Tools like `ffuf`,`Sublist3r` or `amass` can be used along with a common wordlist

##### **3.4 Authentication Bypass**
Authentication is a system's way to find out if we are a legit user or not. Bypassing it means tricking the system to get inside without any id or password. If an attacker is successful in authentication bypassing, they can:
- Access admin panels without being admin
- View user data, internal dashboards or restricted APIs
- Launch further attacks (uploading shells, session stealing etc)

There are different ways to perform authentication bypass:
1. **Using default credentials**: We can use basic username and passwords to access into the system. e.g. `admin:admin`, `test:test`, `admin:password123`
2. **SQL injections**: We use classic code `' OR '1'='1` which always returns true, so a vulnerable website will consider these credentials as true and will give access. 
3. **Broken Logic**: It happens when the application skips some steps, or directly trust the client side responses. e.g.
	- Login forms only check usernames and not passwords
	- access admin page by directly adding `/admin` in the url
	- `"isAdmin":false` can be changed to true in request if its visible using DevTools or even advanced tools like BurpSuite
4. **Poor session management**: Sessions are used to track the user after they login. If the session tokens are hard coded, like `admin:1234` then they can be copied to impersonate the user. Or, using predictable cookies like `userID=1` or `userID=2`.4
5. **Path Manipulation or Forced Browsing**: We login as a regular user and then try putting `/admin` or `/dashboard` etc to get direct access without authentication. 

*Tools like BurpSuite, Firefox DevTools, SQLMap, Gobuster, Hydra etc are especially used for authentication bypass*

##### **3.5 IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)
It is when an app exposes references to objects like UIDs, order numbers, documents etc and doesn't check if we are allowed to access them. In simple terms, if we know the object ID, system assumes that we have the permission to access it. 

IDOR shows up un the places where user-controlled input is used to retrieve data:
- URLs : `GET /profile?user_id=1001
- API calls:  `POST /orders/view { "order_id": 5555 }`
- Files and documents: `GET /invoice/123.pdf`
- Delete/edit actions:  `DELETE /comment?id=456`

With the help of IDOR, we can: 
- Access someone else’s **profile**
- View another user’s **order history**
- Download private **documents or invoices**
- Delete or modify **other users' data**
- Escalate privileges in apps with poor validation

*Tools like BurpSuite, DevTools, Postman etc are used for IDOR*
